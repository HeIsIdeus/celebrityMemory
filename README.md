Information
=================================
An example of a simple Memory Game (match pairs) developed in
HTML5, normalize.js, jQuery (javascript) and loDash (javascript)

The game is not 100% finished. It's a first version and there's room for a ton of improvements,
optimizations, etc. The most complete version is the one developed with
lodashJS, because is using the amazing JS libraries to make the game
behavior possible (shuffle, etc.)

Testing
================================
For testing the games, the best way is to do it on a localhost on your
computer. Otherway, some of the games won't properly work (cross domain
permissions, etc).

Purpose
===============================
The main purpose of this experiment is to try to make a simple, yet sexy
 game as fast as I can with some different technologies out there.

My background has always been HTML5 & CSS3 so I wanted to make a quick
working version to showcase that knowledge.

Technologies
==============================
lodash (http://www.lodash.com/) → Lo-Dash is an exciting cross-platform
utility library that targets Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, BlackBerry,
Flash and HTML5. Its genius as a library is in delivering consistency,
customization, performance, & extras.

jQuery (http://www.jquery.com/) → A widely adopted Javascript library
for building rich, interactive experiences with HTML5.
It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event
handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that
works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility
and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people
write JavaScript.
